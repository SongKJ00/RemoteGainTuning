# RemoteGainTuning
GUI for Remote Gain Tuning with Zigbee(for Drone)

If you download the .exe file, you can tune gain value of your own drone with zigbee.

In my project, I used 4 PID controllers for controlling Roll, Pitch, Yaw, Altitude.

For use this program, you should connect zigbee module with USB to TTL, and connect that to computer USB port.

## Packet Structure

If you click the 'TRANSMIT' Button, the packet will be transmitted.

The packet structure is listed as below;

| Head 1 | Head 2 | Type | Payload | Tail | Checksum |
|:------:|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----:|:----------:|
| 0x53 | 0x4D | See belows | See belows | 0x50 | See belows |

* Head 1, Head 2

  Head 1, Head 2 are start bytes and fixed. 

* Type

  Type is explained that which gain will be changed.
  
  | Type | Contents |
  |:----:|:------------:|
  | 0x41 | Roll P Gain |
  | 0x42 | Roll I Gain |
  | 0x43 | Roll D Gain |
  | 0x44 | Pitch P Gain |
  | 0x45 | Pitch I Gain |
  | 0x46 | Pitch D Gain |
  | 0x47 | Yaw P Gain |
  | 0x48 | Yaw I Gain |
  | 0x49 | Yaw D Gain |
  | 0x77 | Altitude P Gain |
  | 0x78 | Altitude I Gain |
  | 0x79 | Altitude D Gain |
  
  
* Payload<br>
  Payload consists of 4 bytes(uint8_t).
  
  You will put gain value in textbox with float type, it will be changed to 4 bytes with uint8_t type by using Union(I used ctypes module).
  
* Tail

  Tail is just end byte and fixed with 0x50.
  
* Checksum

    Checksum is for checking packet integrity.<br>
   When you click the 'TRANSMIT' button, this program will calculate checksum automatically.<br>
    At recevier side, add all byte of each packets including checksum and if its result's lower byte is 0x00, it means it has no problem and the packet was transmitted successfully.
